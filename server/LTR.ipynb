RE models usually ignore such readily available side information. In this paper, we propose RESIDE, a distantly-supervised neural relation extraction method which utilizes additional side information from KBs for improved relation extraction. It uses entity type and relation alias information for imposing soft constraints while predicting relations. RESIDE employs Graph Convolution Networks (GCN) to encode syntactic information from text and improves performance even when limited side information is available. Through extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, we demonstrate RESIDE's effectiveness. We have made RESIDE's source code available to encourage reproducible research.\",\n",

This paper argues that understanding such information graphics is a discourse-level problem. In particular, it requires assimilating information from multiple knowledge sources to recognize the intended message of the graphic, just as recognizing intention in text does. Moreover, when an article is composed of text and graphics, the intended message of the information graphic (its discourse intention) must be integrated into the discourse structure of the surrounding text and contributes to the overall discourse intention of the article. This paper describes how we extend plan-based techniques that have been used for understanding traditional discourse to the understanding of information graphics. This work is part of a project to develop an interactive natural language system that provides sight-impaired users with access to information graphics.',\n",

Our method uses a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) with an attention mechanism and multi-task learning that processes each character in the tweet to estimate whether the tweet includes important information. In our experiment, we compared two types of attention mechanism and compared their types with/without multi-task learning.

The semantic factors of reflexivity have been examined in a number of studies, and they are known to be of relevance to the te-ir construction of result interpretation as well as to the availability of the tear construction. It has not been made explicit, however, whether the reflexivity is a lexical property of a predicate or it is part of the pragmatic information or the information provided in the actual event in context. I will demonstrate that reflexivity relevant in the two constructions derives from two separate sources; the reflexivity as lexically-encoded information and the reflexivity as contextually-supported. The interaction of lexicon and pragmatics has been studied from various points of view. The definition of lexical information and that of pragmatic information varies across theories. The present study suggests one way of discriminating the two. 1. LEXICAL INFORMATION AND PRAGMATIC INFORMATION It has been of much concern these days how lexicon is to be structured. Lexicon was once thought of as a simple list of words with a limited set of information necessary for syntactic mapping. In the trend of lexlicalism which dates back to early 1980s, more emphasis came to be placed on lexicon. At the same time, syntax was simplified and generalized. The more simplified the syntax was, the more complicated the lexicon had to be, since the overall complexity of linguistic structures was never reduced. For instance, one of the essential parts of lexical information is argument structure. The argument structure used to be more closely tied to subcategorization, which is relevant to syntactic mapping. As argument structure was elaborated in a greater detail, it came to be more associated with event structure of verbs, examining more closely at the semantic side of information than the syntactic side. The event structure is closely tied to the way the event denoted by the verb canonically evolves in the real world. This means that lexical information necessarily draws on extra-linguistic information. It is well-known that the interpretation of a sentence is greatly affected by pragmatic, contextual factors of various kind. However, it is not true that pragmatic factors can do anything. Many sentences are never grammatical in whatever kind of context they are used. In fact, the extent to which pragmatics can override syntactic restrictions is very limited. Pragmatic effect is usually of more modest kind: it, for instance, disambiguates the referent of a pronoun, or it saves a sentence which is grammatically correct but is uninterpretable due to semantic anomaly. There are still cases where pragmatic factors interact more closely with syntactic restrictions. Then the question is how pragmatic information interacts with syntactic and lexical information of constituent words.1',\n",

       "  {'abstract': \"Intelligent dialogue systems must be able to respond properly to a variety of requests involving knowledge of the dialogue , the task at hand, and the domain. This requires advanced knowledge reasoning performed by various processing modules. We argue that it is important to understand the nature of the various reasoning mechanisms involved and to separate not only, for instance, interpretation , generation, and dialogue management but also domain knowledge and task reasoning. This facilitates portabili-ty of the dialogue system to new domains and makes it easier to enhance its capabilities. In this paper we will focus on the dialogue and domain knowledge reasoning components and show how they can cooperate to achieve natural interaction. 1 Introduction As information services and domains grow more complex the complexity of dialogue systems increases. They tend to need more and more domain knowledge and the domain reasoning mechanisms also have to become more sophisticated. Utilis-ing domain knowledge reasoning is in many cases necessary for a dialogue system to interpret and respond to a request in an intelligent manner, especially as requests can be vague and sometimes ambiguous. This involves not only requests for information from application specific knowledge sources, but also requests related to the properties and structures of the application and requests that are outside the scope of the application. Thus, dialogue systems must be able to access, gather and integrate knowledge from various domain knowledge sources and application systems in order to determine the precise meaning of a request and produce an appropriate response. However, although the dialogue system gather information from various sources it differs from the information retrieval problem discussed for instance in Stein et al. (1999). We assume that the tasks are well-defined and that the users have articulated information needs that they can express in specific terms. In this paper we will discuss how these different tasks can be performed in dialogue systems of simple service character, i.e. dialogue systems that can provide information given a set of parameters collected from the user (Hayes and Reddy, 1983). 2 Types of requests and clarifications Users interacting with a dialogue system utilise various communicative acts. Bunt (1989) makes a distinction between factual information acts and dialogue control acts. The latter is used to control the dialogue and the former involves any transfer of factual information. Factual information requests can be further divided into two basic types of requests: • Task related requests. Requests where the response from the dialogue system includes domain and task specific information • System related requests. Requests where the response includes information on what can be done with the system or pointers to other information sources To be able to respond to questions on the sys-tem's capabilities and how to interpret the provided information, the dialogue system needs to represent knowledge about itself, here called system information. Also, if an answer can not be found in the application system(s) the dialogue system should give as helpful information as possible , for example suggesting other resources the user can consult. For this purpose knowledge is needed on where such information can be found. The requests for task related information can be divided into simple and complex requests. Simple requests are basically requests for information 121\",\n",

In this paper, we illustrate what the lexical semantics of reporting verbs must incorporate in order to contribute to the reconstruction of story and context. The lexical structures proposed are derived from the analysis of semantic collocations over large text corpora. I Motivation We can distinguish two levels in newspaper articles: the pure information, here called primary informa-lion, and the meta-informati0n , which embeds the primary information within a perspective, a belief context, or a modality, which we call circumstan.-tim information. The distinction is not limited to, but is best illustrated by, reported speech sentences. Here the matrix clause or reporting clause corresponds to the circumstantial:information, while the complement (whether realized as a full clause or as a noun phrase) corresponds t'o primary information. For tasks such as knowledge extraction it is the primary information that is of interest. For example in the text of Figure 1 the matrix clauses (italicized) give the circumstantial information of the who, when and how of the reporting event, while what is reported (the primary information) is givel~ in tile complements. The particular reporting verb also adds important information about the manner of the original utterance , the preciseness of tile quote, the temporal rela-I, iolJship between ,uatrix clause and e(mq~h:me,l,, aml more. In addition, the source of tile original information provides information about the reliability or credibility of the primary information.

Although digital information repositories are becoming truly multimedial, human language will remain the only medium for preserving and sharing complex concepts, experiences and ideas. It is also the only medium suited for expressing metainformation. For a human reader a text has a rich structure, for a data processing machine it is merely a string of symbols. Classical information retrieval helps to sort and find information in large libraries of documents by matching strings of characters. Effective information management is a building block of modern knowledge management. However, language technology can contribute much more than methods for finding information. A number of areas in which language technologies can improve knowledge management are described in Maybury (in this volume). We will concentrate on examples in which language technologies can facilitate the creation of new knowledge from large volumes of textual information and the sharing of knowledge accross language boundaries. 1 Knowledge Sharing One of the true challenges of KM is the development and implementation of schemes that make people share knowledge and use such shared knowledge in critical situations. Offering incentives for the sharing of knowledge is not sufficient. The valuable information needs to be offered in situations where it is needed. It also needs to be evaluated in such situations because any effective incentive scheme might lead to information overflow if the quality of the provided information cannot be assessed. Language technology can provide means for associating shared knowledge with the relevant decision situations by automatically linking it to the critical elements within decision triggers, i.e, electronic documents in the workflow that demand and record a decision. Together with some simple statistical methods this method can also support a scheme for evaluating shared information with a minimum of additional effort. The language technology that can be applied for this purpose we call automatic relational hyperlinking. Relational hyperlinks differ from the simple hyperlinks of HTML in that they are composed out of a number of named links that can be selected from a menu. Language technology is needed for identifying and disambiguating the concepts in documents that need to be linked. To this end, techniques from information extraction are employed such as named entity recognition. When automatic hyperlinking associates information to decision situations, an evaluation can be enforced without an additional burden on the user. Automatic hyperlinking can also be applied for transforming information into knowledge-like structures. By densely interconnecting informational elements, three criteria are met that distinguish knowledge from other forms of information: immediate accessability, grounding of pieces of knowledge and associative',\n",

In this paper, we use document level information to improve the performance of ACE event extraction. In contrast to previous work, we do not limit ourselves to information about events of the same type, but rather use information about other types of events to make predictions or resolve ambiguities regarding a given event. We learn such relationships from the training corpus and use them to help predict the occurrence of events and event arguments in a text.

One advantage of this bundled information is its reusability, which allows redundancy to be reduced. The representation of lexical information should enable us to express a further kind of generalization, namely the relations between regularity, sub-regularity, and irregularity. Furthermore, the representation has to be computationaUy tracta-ble and-possibly with the addition of\"syntac-tic sugar\"-more or less readable for human users. 1 MOTIVATION In the project \"Simulation of Lexical Acquisition\" (SIMLEX) unification is used to create new lexical entries through the monoto-nic accumulation of contextual grammatical information during parsing. The system which we implemented for this purpose is a variant of PATR as described in (Shieber, 1986). Besides collecting the appropriate infor-marion for an unknown word, i.e. a lexeme not already specified in the given lexicon, the creation of its new lexical entry is a major goal. In this context questions about the nature of lexical information, the structuring, and the representation of this information must be answered. The present paper is mainly concerned with the structuring and representation of infor-marion in lexical entries. 2 REPRESENTATION OF LEXICAL INFORMATION The formalism of PATR offers two possible means of representing lexical information. First of all, the information can be encoded in feature structures directly. Except for computational tractability, none of the other criteria are met. The second facility consists of macros or templates which assemble the lin-gnistic information so that it can be reused in various places in the lexicon. This meets the most important of the above-mentioned conditions and reduces redundancy. But the encoded information is inherited monotonically, i.e. only regularities can be expressed. In order to structure lexical information adequately, other relations like subregularities and exceptions should also be expressible. Macros fail to achieve this, whereas default inheritance networks are well-suited for the purpose. In the following section we give an overview of one such network formalism which was primarily designed for representing lexical information. We assume that certain conditions must be met by an adequate representation of lexical information. The most important of these is that it captures linguistic generalizations, which-137',\n",

The ARPA and Intelligence Community sponsored TIPSTER program has risen to this challenge. New technologies have been developed for attacking problems in information retrieval, information extraction, and multilingual information processing. As a premier developer of neural network based technologies, HNC has played an important role in successfully bringing innovative approaches to the problem of information retrieval, including multilingual information retrieval. The purpose of this brief paper is to summarize HNC\\'s research accomplishments and to make recommendations for further study. The HNC approach to information retrieval is based on context vectors, which are unit vectors in a high dimensional vector space. The relative directions of these vectors encode the meaning and context of information that is to be retrieved. Neural network based training laws are used to adjust the components of these vectors in an iterative fashion. The basic context vector methodology has been implemented in a system called MatchPlus, which serves as a stand-alone information retrieval application as well as the technological core upon which additional context vector applications have been built. One problem with the MatchPlus system has been the large computation requirements of the learning law. In order to reduce the severity of this problem, HNC has developed a one step learning law that approximates the behavior of the original learning law at a fraction of the computational cost. Preliminary performance results with this learning law have been quite encouraging. More complete performance results can be generated when additional funding becomes available. HNC has also developed a preliminary prototype of an English-Spanish MatchPlus system. This system uses redundant hash table addressing to store context vectors for a multilingual vocabulary. This system can easily be extended to additional languages, such as Japanese, Russian, Chinese, etc. The multilingual MatchPlus approach is able to perform information retrieval in multiple languages without the necessity of specifying any grammatical information about the language, thereby greatly reducing system development time. HNC\\'s context vector technology has also been extended to the problem of information routing and filtering, resulting in a COTS product known as CONVECTIS. CONVECTIS is currently being used by DataTimes (a large commercial information provider) as the core technology for routing information to customers based on customer specified \"interest profiles.\" The use of context vectors results in a natural method for specifying degree of relationship between incoming news feeds and customer interests. It is also a natural mechanism for detecting novel information themes, a fact that could be advantageously used by the Intelligence Community. HNC has also responded to the explosion of information available on the Internet by developing a system of autonomous retrieval agents based upon the MatchPlus technology. These retrieval agents can be scheduled by the user to access information at specified, possibly repeated times, thereby removing the requirement that the user actually be present during the retrieval operation. This system is currently being extended to handle multiple Internet and for-fee database protocols, resulting in a useful system for information retrieval from heterogeneous information sources. Since the context vector methodology requires only that a finite vocabulary of entities be defined for the domain of information, this technology has been extended to other media, images in particular. The ICARS system is being developed to solve the difficult problem of image retrieval and image content characterization. This system attaches context vectors to cluster centroids of feature vectors composed of Gabor features and color information. 45',\n",

ABSTRACT The design of the template for an information extraction application (or exercise) mfieets the nature of the task and therefore crucially affects the success of the attempt to capture information from text. This paper addresses the template design requirement by discussing the general principles or desiderata of template design, object-oriented vs. fiat template design, and template deft-nition notation, all reflecting the results and lessons learned in the TIPSTER/MUC-5 template definition effort which is explicitly discussed in a Case Study in the last section of this paper. 2. GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS The design of the template needs to balance a number of (often conflicting) goals, as reflected by these desiderata, which apply primarily to object-oriented templates (see below), but also have applicability to fiat-structure templates as well. Some of these desiderata reflect well-known, good database design practices, whereas others are particular to Information Extraction. Some of these desiderata are further illusl~ated in the Case Study section below. • DESCRIPTIVE ADEQUACY-the requirement for a template to represent all of the information necessary for the task or application at hand. At times the inclusion of one type of information requires the inclusion of other, supporting, information (for example, measurements require specification of units, and temporally dynamic relations require temporal parametrization). • CLARITY-the ability to represent information in the template unambiguously, and for that information to be manipulable by computer applications without further inference. Depending on the application, any ambiguity in the text may result in either representation of that ambiguity in the template, or representation of default (or inferred) values, or omission of that ambiguous information altogether.',\n",

These constituents differ from each other in the way in which they are constructed and realized. Generally speaking, prosodic structure is sensitive to syntactic structure and influenced by the syntax-despite the difference between prosodic and syntactic constituency. In listening to political speeches, one cannot help but notice the division of the stream of speech produced by its speakers; it differs markedly from what is expected, especially with respect to both the matching conditions with syntactic structure and the shape of the contours. The present paper is a systematic study of chunking produced in a political speech by Jacques Chirac. The goal is twofold: First, to uncover the factors intervening in the construction of the prosodic constituents and second, to determine the ways in which they resemble or differ from established assumptions pertaining to standard French.

In this paper, we explore prosodic cues to discourse segmentation in human-computer dialogue. Using data drawn from 60 hours of interactions with a voice-only conversational spoken language system, we identify pitch and intensity features that signal segment boundaries.

It has been available for a while as a toolkit for English and it has been frequently tested on English gold standards. In this paper , we describe how we constructed a Dutch gold standard that matches the En-glish gold standard as closely as possible. We also re-implemented the Word-Net::Similarity package to be able to deal with any wordnet that is specified in Wordnet-LMF format independent of the language. This opens up the possibility to compare the similarity measures across wordnets and across languages. It also provides a new way of comparing wordnet structures across languages through one of its core aspects: the synonymy and hy-ponymy structure. In this paper, we report on the comparison between Dutch and En-glish wordnets and gold standards. This comparison shows that the gold standards, and therefore the intuitions of English and Dutch native speakers, appear to be highly compatible. We also show that our package generates similar results for English as reported earlier and good results for Dutch.

      "<Hit {'abstract': 'This paper describes an experimental method for detecting prosodic functions. We assume that the first step towards content driven synthetic prosody generation (Concept-to-speech) is invariably to determine the perceptually relevant prosodic features. The proposed method has been applied to the detection of syntactic structure: dialogue acts and given/new distinction. First results are being discussed. 1 Motivation Within the framework of Concept-to-speeclh our aim is to integrate additonal information such as struc-turing, focus: dialogue act: speaker attitude into the prosodic modelling of synthesized utterances. The first step into this direction is to find out which additional information is reflected in the prosodic structure. An investigation as to what information about the content of an utterance is actually encoded in the prosody and how this coding is realized by the natural speaker is inherently necessary [Lib74]. The aim for more natural prosody generation can only be determined by an adequate description of human prosody and its interaction with content information. In this paper we propose a method determining which linguistic concepts have a functional influence on prosody. Prosody is known to be of a very complex nature, yet we cannot per se suggest that every communicative function is relevantly encoded it, in. At least we have to distinguish between functions that necessarily pertain to the prosodic structure: and those that are not identifiably located within prosody. Once the relevant concepts have been found: their influence on the acoustic parameters related to prosody can be investigated. 2 Methodological description 2.1 Idea Prosodic function has been discussed frequently, e.g. [Bar81,Leo70,Koh87]. One major problem is the separation of prosodic and segmental influences. In applications with no control over spectral qualities: such as time-domain concatenative synthesis systems , only prosodic parameters can be modified to convey linguistic concepts. To qualify and quantify the information contained in the prosody~ we use specially designed perception tests. The segmen-tal information in the stimuli is removed: in order to make sure that all information is carried by the prosody alone. 2.2 Choice of stimuli Many previous experiments on prosody have been forced to employ ambiguous test sentences or words which is clearly suboptimal. With our method the semantic content of the stimuli becomes irrelevant to the test results and the optimal stimuli for a given task can be used. Also, the stinmli can be extracted from a read text or from a natural dialogue situation: as long as the quality of the recording is not too degraded. 2.3 Stimuli manipulation A stimulus is constructed on the basis of the points of glottal excitation (pitchmarks) of the original signal while preserving the energy. The manipulated stinmli contain only prosodic information: F0 contour , temporal structure and energy distribution. Thus, they reflect exactly the parameters that can be varied using PSOLA [Mou90]. Different stimulus manipulation methods have been compared in the validation test series (3). 2.4 Test procedure Depending on the aim of the investigation: the manipulated stimuli are presented either with or with-57', 'area': '', 'path': 'W97-1208.tei.xml', 'title': 'Looking for the presence of linguistic concepts in the prosody of spoken utterances'}>\n",
      "<Hit {'abstract': 'PROJECT GOALS The goal of this project is to investigate the use of different levels of prosodic information in speech recognition and understanding. In particular, the current focus of the work is the use of prosodic phrase boundary information in parsing. The research involves determining a representation of prosodic information suitable for use in a speech understanding system, developing reliable algorithms for detection of the prosodic cues in speech, investigating architec-tures for integrating prosodic cues in a parser, and evaluating the potential improvements of prosody in the context of the SRI Spoken Language System. This research is sponsored jointly by DARPA and NSF. RECENT RESULTS • Investigated duration lengthening at different levels of prosodic breaks over different types of units (e.g., final syllable, interstress interval), finding that the primary region of lengthening is the phrase-final, word-final syllable rhyme. • Implemented a binary tree quantizer in our HMM prosodic phrase boundary detection system, which enabled the use of multiple cues determined from the above analysis. A new algorithm for adapting model parameters has also been implemented. The resulting algorithm has speaker-independent break recognition performance above the level of our previous speaker-dependent system. A paper describing this work (Wightman and Ostendorf) appears in the Proceedings of the International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing. • Submitted for publication an article describing a perceptual , phonological and phonetic analysis of the relationship between prosodic structure and syntactic structure. A shortened version of this paper (Price et al.) appears in this volume. (This work was also funded by a related grant on prosody, NSF grant number IRI-8805680.) • Developed an initial version of an analysis-by-synthesis approach for scoring a syntactic parse in terms of the SRI International Menlo Park, CA 94025 observed prosodic constituents. This algorithm leverages recent results on the role of prosody in disam-biguation, mentioned above. We assessed this method by using the algorithm to decide between pairs of ambiguous sentences, finding that the algorithm performance is close to human perception.

      "<Hit {'abstract': 'Cue phrases are linguistic expressions such as now and well that function as explicit indicators of the structure of a discourse. For example, now may signal the beginning of a subtopic or a return to a previous topic, while well may mark subsequent material as a response to prior material, or as an explanatory comment. However, while cue phrases may convey discourse structure, each also has one or more alternate uses. While incidentally may be used sententially as an adverbial, for example, the discourse use initiates a digression. Although distinguishing discourse and sentential uses of cue phrases is critical to the interpretation and generation of discourse, the question of how speakers and hearers accomplish this disambiguation is rarely addressed. This paper reports results of empirical studies on discourse and sentential uses of cue phrases, in which both text-based and prosodic features were examined for disambiguating power. Based on these studies, it is proposed that discourse versus sentential usage may be distinguished by intonational features, specifically, pitch accent and prosodic phrasing. A prosodic model that characterizes these distinctions is identified. This model is associated with features identifiable from text analysis, including orthography and part of speech, to permit the application of the results of the prosodic analysis to the generation of appropriate intonational features for discourse and sentential uses of cue phrases in synthetic speech.', 'area': '', 'path': 'J93-3003.tei.xml', 'title': 'Empirical Studies on the Disambiguation of Cue Phrases'}>\n",
